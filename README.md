All the data has been taken from:- https://data.gov.in/

Bar Plot:
The plot shows the rainfall measured in the month of January(2012) in the various districts of Haryana. Here, the bar plot is an appropriate representation of the data since it enables us to compare which districts experienced more rainfall than others. It is easy to conclude from the plot that Ambala, Karnal and Sonipat received high amounts of rainfall in the said period while the districts Kaithal, Rohtak and Jhajjar experienced only meagre amounts of rainfall.

Scatter Plot:
The plot shows the growth of population in Haryana through 1961-2000 (Some of the data has been trimmed). The plot enhances the direct proportionality between time and population numbers in the state, which is expected.

Box Plot:
The data used in this is the average scores in three Mathematics tests conducted in the various states of India. The box plots indicate how the mark distribution is for each test. In the first test, the variance of marks is more than that in the second test. The mean marks scored by students is higher in the second test than in the first. The first two tests, having the same total marks, are more easily comparable than the third, which has a mean of about 250 marks.
